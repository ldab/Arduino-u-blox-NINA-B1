## How to build PlatformIO based project

1. [Install PlatformIO Core](http://docs.platformio.org/page/core.html)
2. Download [development platform with examples](https://github.com/platformio/platform-nordicnrf52/archive/develop.zip)
3. Extract ZIP archive
4. Run these commands:

```
# Change directory to example
> cd platform-nordicnrf52/examples/Arduino-u-blox-NINA-B1

# Build project
> platformio run

# Upload firmware
> platformio run --target upload

# Build specific environment
> platformio run -e nina_b1

# Upload firmware for the specific environment
> platformio run -e nina_b1 --target upload

# Clean build files
> platformio run --target clean
```

## Why?

This example tries to implement some key functions and key PIN atributes in order to get you started with using Arduino and the NRF52832 BLE board u-blox NINA-B1.

Timer functionas are implemented intead of `delay()` and the PINs have been re-mapped on the `#define` section

## Bluetooth iOS and Android app 

You can download the sample Bluetooth low energy app - BLE App straight from u-blox wesite: [https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/bluetooth-ios-and-android-app](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/bluetooth-ios-and-android-app)

## fatal error: ble_gatts.h: No such file or directory

The arduino-nRF5x core **REQUIRES** a SoftDevice in order to successfully use this library. Please see [Flashing a SoftDevice](https://github.com/sandeepmistry/arduino-nRF5#selecting-a-softdevice).

On PlatformIO and when using this example you don't need to do anything special as the `build_flags = -DNRF52_S132` has already been included on `platform.ini` file.

SoftDevices contain the BLE stack and housekeeping, and must be downloaded once before a sketch using BLE can be loaded. The SD consumes ~5k of Ram + some extra based on actual BLE configuration.

* SoftDevice S132 v2.0.1 supports nRF52 in peripheral and central role. It is 112k in size.
